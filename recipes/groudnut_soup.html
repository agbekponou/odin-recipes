    <h2>Groundnut Soup About</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favourite Ghanaian meals. It is delicious, warming,
        savoury and guaranteed to be one of your favourite Ghanaian dishes too. 
        It is often made with poultry, stewing hen and smoked turkey but you can definitely 
        make this with other meats like beed, lam, goat etc. The poultry or meat is seasoned, steamed
        and a tomato and onion based broth is added to this and of course a peanut butter (groundnut mixture).
        The soup is simmered till the oil and fat from the meat and peanut butter settle on top and it is served 
        with a perfectly rounded ball of white rice.
